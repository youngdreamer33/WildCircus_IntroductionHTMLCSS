             Bruno, our animal keeper, will show you how smart our Monkeys are but also how great they are at dancing. They might be better than you, but hey, don't be jealous: they are profesional after all. Some of them are also world famous musicians, they even helped Bruno in his musical ventures ! And we are pretty sure that if they don't eat all their bananas, they'll put one on your face. </br> The music will be carefully curated by our MC who's <em>gonna</em> lit the entire circus ! Seats optional, water complimentary. Of course.

            <h2>More than an Artist, a Dreamer </h2>
            <p> The Wild Circus won't be anything without the work and philosophy of our dear friend Kanye. He is and will always remain a true inspiration for every Dreamers around the world. As he likes to say: " In the World, there are two kinds of people: Dreamers and Haters. The only difference between them is that Haters forgot about theirs dreams so they'd rather take down everyone's dream.". We owe him and more importantly we owe us to believe in our dreams and to keep chasing them. This Circus is directly inspired by his philosophy and our shared will to make this world better. </br> As a tribute for his work and dreams, we share with you a video from his critically acclaimed album <em> My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy </em> in which he describes himself as a monster. <strong>So wild</strong>.

Our philosophy is very simple: <strong>come as you are</strong>. We learnt it from our former employer but we work really hard to make it ours too. We want our guests to have the best experience possible. We want them to be part of the show, live it to the fullest and not only watch it. </p>
            <p>At the Wild Circus Company, we value humane health and happiness as much as we care about our animals. No animal is hurt during our shows or between. Some of our competitors are not like that: they are not wild, they are simply inhumane. Please don't support their actions, don't be a part of those atrocities. </p>
 			<p>We can make this world better, together: that's our purpose. This Circus is just a mere drop in the Ocean but without mere drops they wouldn’t be any Ocean…</p>
